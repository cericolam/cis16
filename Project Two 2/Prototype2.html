    The American Way of Warfare
  </div>

  <div class="body1">
    Founded and rooted in Enlightenment values, the U.S. is caught between two conflicting imperatives when it comes to war achieving security through the annihilation of threats; and a requirement to conduct itself in a liberal and humane manner. In order to reconcile these conflicting requirements, the U.S. has often turned to scientists and laboratories to find strategies that are both decisive and humane.

In this talk he'll explore how this national style stacks up against current and future strategic challenges.
