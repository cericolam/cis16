    Founded and rooted in Enlightenment values, the U.S. is caught between two conflicting imperatives when it comes to war achieving security through the annihilation of threats; and a requirement to conduct itself in a liberal and humane manner. In order to reconcile these conflicting requirements, the U.S. has often turned to scientists and laboratories to find strategies that are both decisive and humane. This approach has yielded many success, but it has also resulted in some disastrous errors. In this lecture Professor Williams will explore the relationship between technology, law, and liberalism in America's approach to warfare and how this national style stacks up against current and future strategic challenges.
    Michael John Williams is Clinical Professor of International Relations, Director of the International Relations Program and Affiliate Professor of European Studies and History at New York University.
