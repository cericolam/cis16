    It's hard to believe, but 80 percent of all diseases around the world are caused by unsafe water. Now, one man is making it his mission to change that.
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="p two">
    Another startling statistic is that 4,500 children die every day around the world because of exposure to dirty water.
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="p three">
    But dirty water can be remedied so easily, and that's the motivation behind the organization simply called Charity.
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="p four">
    We may not think a whole lot about water in America. Scott Harrison certainly didn't give it much thought, until he volunteered in Africa.
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="p five">
   "When we went into villages, we saw people drinking from swamps," he said. "It's water we wouldn't walk in, certainly not give it to our animals. And this is the water the children were drinking." 
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="p six">
    He even brought back some of that water and had it tested. It was filled with parasites. The experiences Scott had abroad prompted the former night club promoter to shift gears and promote water, and the safe drinking of it throughout the world.
  </div>

  <div class="p seven">
    A year and a half ago, the New Yorker launched the non-profit called Charity. The goal is to build well, or catchment, projects in communities where there is no clean water.
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="p eight">
   "For about $5,000, we can give anywhere between 400 and 800 people clean water, just by building a well," he said. 
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="p nine">
    Money is raised in a number of ways, including through the sale of $5 bracelets and $20 bottles of water, which are sold not so much for the water, but the cause.
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="p ten">
    Donations and fundraisers are also helpful, and to get the word out, Charity has also created a moving public service announcement featuring actress Jennifer Connelly. And it's all working. So far, 633 water projects are underway in 11 countries. But there is still much more to be done.
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="p eleven">
    "When a billion people have clean water," Harrison said, when asked when he'd stop. "So we have a lot of customers."
  </div>

  <br>

  <div class="p twelve">
    So far, Scott's organization has been able to provide water for a quarter of a million people. It's a good start in just a little more than a year. Each well, by the way, produces 7 million glasses of clean water a year.
